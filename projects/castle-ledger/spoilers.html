        <strong>Heads up:</strong> This is a step-by-step route to finish the Chronicle of Beldane Keep.
        Read only what you need!
      </div>

      <h2>Outer ring priorities</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Start on the southern road and buy the salted pork from the butcher for two silver pennies.</li>
        <li>Visit Matilde the ropemaker in the southeastern shanties. Pass her quiz however you like, then pay two pennies to secure the coil of hemp rope.</li>
        <li>Take the detour to the mill jetty. With the rope in hand you can splice the sluice cord, earn a bonus penny, and gain the miller’s recommendation.</li>
        <li>Continue around the wall to the priory. Answer Brother Aldwin correctly (&ldquo;One denier per bolt, unless sworn to the guild&rdquo;) to obtain the wax tablet.</li>
        <li>Loop through the hunters’ grounds to assist the leech, earning the linen bandage. Keep the salted pork for later.</li>
        <li>At the eastern postern, toss the salted pork to distract the mastiff and secure your rope to the ring. Climb down once the hound leaves for the pond.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Establishing yourself inside</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Inside the outer bailey, give the linen bandage to the wounded guard at the training yard gate so the yard opens freely.</li>
        <li>Speak with the master-at-arms during weapons drill to make sure you are known to the garrison.</li>
        <li>Visit the guard station after hearing about the pigeon warning from either the stables or loft. Accept the sealed dispatch.</li>
        <li>Deliver the sealed dispatch to Sir Merrick at the training yard. This triggers the request to fortify the rear bridge.</li>
        <li>Collect the iron spike from Hrodgar the smith once Sir Merrick has vouched for you.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Securing the keep and closing the ledger</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Exit the castle via the postern and circle to the rear service bridge. Use the iron spike to brace the winch and mark the bridge as secured.</li>
        <li>Report back to the guard station so the sergeants update their rolls.</li>
        <li>Proceed to the great hall, observe the rotating court case, and when prompted deliver your readiness report to the earl.</li>
        <li>After the earl rewards your diligence, you are free to continue exploring for additional flavor text or reset the ledger for a fresh run.</li>
      </ol>
