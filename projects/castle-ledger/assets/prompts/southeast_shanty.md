# Shanties of the Ropewalkers — Illustration Prompt

## Castle Ledger Illustration Prompt Template

Use the following structure for every generated image:

**Base Prompt**  
Create a richly detailed, roughly square digital illustration sized to sit beside narrative text on desktop or mobile screens. Depict a grounded late-medieval world centered on Beldane Keep. Emphasize tactile materials—weathered stone, damp timber, wool, steel, parchment—and atmospheric light with gentle bloom. Compose the scene as if painted in gouache with subtle ink outlines, blending illuminated-manuscript ornamentation with contemporary fantasy concept art clarity. Keep color palettes earthy with selective heraldic accents in crimson, deep blue, and gold.

**Rendering Guidance**  
- Framing: focus on the named location or character grouping, filling most of the frame while leaving breathable space above and below so the artwork can stack with text.  
- Aspect & scale: aim for a square canvas that could crop cleanly; no cinematic black bars.  
- Lighting: natural ambient light with localized highlights (torches, braziers, sun shafts) to guide the eye.  
- Mood: adventurous but grounded, conveying the tension of impending siege preparations paired with everyday duty.  
- Avoid: modern objects, anachronistic clothing, extreme caricature; no visible UI or text overlays.

After this shared template, append location-specific details that describe the composition, key props, characters, and atmosphere for that particular room.

## Location-Specific Direction
- Composition: Angle the scene along the moat with patchwork shanties leaning toward the water, guiding the eye toward Matilde’s rope rack under a sailcloth awning.
- Key elements: Feature ropewalkers twisting hemp strands, washerwomen beating linen on stones, coils of tarred rope hanging to dry, and bread ovens smoking nearby. Let Matilde beckon with a tar-stained grin.
- Supporting details: Add a mastiff paw print in the mud and a gull circling overhead, hinting at the castle’s defenses and river proximity.
- Atmosphere: Humid afternoon light catching motes of steam and tar vapors, mixing industrious energy with rough-edged charm.
