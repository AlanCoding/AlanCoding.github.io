# Southern Road to Beldane Keep — Illustration Prompt

## Castle Ledger Illustration Prompt Template

Use the following structure for every generated image:

**Base Prompt**  
Create a richly detailed, roughly square digital painting sized to sit beside narrative text on desktop or mobile screens. Depict a grounded late-medieval world centered on Beldane Keep with historically accurate architecture, clothing, and equipment drawn from 13th-14th century Europe. Emphasize tactile materials—weathered stone, damp timber, wool, steel, parchment—and naturalistic light with gentle bloom. Compose the scene with measured perspective and painterly realism reminiscent of manuscript illuminations and early Renaissance panel art, avoiding exaggerated proportions or stylization. Keep the palette earthy with selective heraldic accents in crimson, deep blue, and gold.

**Rendering Guidance**  
- Framing: focus on the named location or character grouping, filling most of the frame while leaving breathable space above and below so the artwork can stack with text.  
- Aspect & scale: aim for a square canvas that could crop cleanly; no cinematic black bars.  
- Lighting: natural ambient light with localized highlights (torches, braziers, sun shafts) to guide the eye.  
- Mood: adventurous but grounded, conveying the tension of impending siege preparations paired with everyday duty.  
- Avoid: modern objects, anachronistic clothing, extreme caricature; no visible UI or text overlays.

After this shared template, append location-specific details that describe the composition, key props, characters, and atmosphere for that particular room.

## Location-Specific Direction
- Composition: View from the muddy road looking up toward Beldane Keep’s raised drawbridge, with the stone walls looming in the background and the lane curving through wagon ruts in the foreground.
- Key elements: Include barley-laden carts, a thatcher mending a lean-to, children fencing with willow sticks, and wisps of kitchen smoke. Tuck the hawthorn shrine with fluttering ribbons to one side as a secondary vignette.
- Character focus: Show the castle clerk approaching with ledger satchel, observed by curious villagers; add a distant guard silhouette atop the gatehouse to hint at scrutiny.
- Atmosphere: Early morning overcast light with cool puddles catching reflections, hinting at recent rain and the quiet tension of duties awaiting within the keep.
