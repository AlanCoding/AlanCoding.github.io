# Eastern Postern Bridge — Illustration Prompt

## Castle Ledger Illustration Prompt Template

Use the following structure for every generated image:

**Base Prompt**  
Create a richly detailed, roughly square digital painting sized to sit beside narrative text on desktop or mobile screens. Depict a grounded late-medieval world centered on Beldane Keep with historically accurate architecture, clothing, and equipment drawn from 13th-14th century Europe. Emphasize tactile materials—weathered stone, damp timber, wool, steel, parchment—and naturalistic light with gentle bloom. Compose the scene with measured perspective and painterly realism reminiscent of manuscript illuminations and early Renaissance panel art, avoiding exaggerated proportions or stylization. Keep the palette earthy with selective heraldic accents in crimson, deep blue, and gold.

**Rendering Guidance**  
- Framing: focus on the named location or character grouping, filling most of the frame while leaving breathable space above and below so the artwork can stack with text.  
- Aspect & scale: aim for a square canvas that could crop cleanly; no cinematic black bars.  
- Lighting: natural ambient light with localized highlights (torches, braziers, sun shafts) to guide the eye.  
- Mood: adventurous but grounded, conveying the tension of impending siege preparations paired with everyday duty.  
- Avoid: modern objects, anachronistic clothing, extreme caricature; no visible UI or text overlays.

After this shared template, append location-specific details that describe the composition, key props, characters, and atmosphere for that particular room.

## Location-Specific Direction
- Composition: Focus on the narrow side bridge over the moat with the barred postern tower looming above, capturing the precarious descent path.
- Key elements: Include the watchful mastiff on the bridge, a coiled rope tied to an iron ring, slick stonework with arrow slits, and the concealed service ladder disappearing into the shadows below.
- Story hints: Show the castle clerk poised to descend while glancing toward distant patrol torches on the wall walk, signaling urgency and stealth.
- Atmosphere: Cool dusk lighting with mist rising from the moat and a subtle glow from within the tower to contrast the murky exterior.
