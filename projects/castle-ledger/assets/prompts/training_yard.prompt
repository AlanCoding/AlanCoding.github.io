# Training Yard — Illustration Prompt

## Castle Ledger Illustration Prompt Template

Use the following structure for every generated image:

**Base Prompt**  
Create a richly detailed, roughly square digital painting sized to sit beside narrative text on desktop or mobile screens. Depict a grounded late-medieval world centered on Beldane Keep with historically accurate architecture, clothing, and equipment drawn from 13th-14th century Europe. Emphasize tactile materials—weathered stone, damp timber, wool, steel, parchment—and naturalistic light with gentle bloom. Compose the scene with measured perspective and painterly realism reminiscent of manuscript illuminations and early Renaissance panel art, avoiding exaggerated proportions or stylization. Keep the palette earthy with selective heraldic accents in crimson, deep blue, and gold.

**Rendering Guidance**  
- Framing: focus on the named location or character grouping, filling most of the frame while leaving breathable space above and below so the artwork can stack with text.  
- Aspect & scale: aim for a square canvas that could crop cleanly; no cinematic black bars.  
- Lighting: natural ambient light with localized highlights (torches, braziers, sun shafts) to guide the eye.  
- Mood: adventurous but grounded, conveying the tension of impending siege preparations paired with everyday duty.  
- Avoid: modern objects, anachronistic clothing, extreme caricature; no visible UI or text overlays.

After this shared template, append location-specific details that describe the composition, key props, characters, and atmosphere for that particular room.

## Location-Specific Direction
- Composition: Capture the open yard ringed by timber galleries, with Sir Merrick centered in commanding stance while squires drill in semicircles around him.
- Key elements: Include archers loosing arrows at straw butts, a drummer keeping cadence, and racks of practice weapons. Let dust swirl from stomping boots.
- Story layer: Show the castle clerk delivering or presenting the sealed dispatch, with Merrick glancing toward the rear gate to emphasize the urgent orders.
- Atmosphere: Golden afternoon light with motes of dust glowing in sunbeams, balancing disciplined motion with the tension of impending conflict.
