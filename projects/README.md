# Projects directory

This folder gathers the static demos and experiments that predate the current Jekyll blog.
Each subdirectory stands alone, so links work when hosted by GitHub Pages:

- `minesweeper/` &mdash; the refactored browser Minesweeper with scripts, assets, and AI persona pages.
- `word-jumble/` &mdash; a letter unscrambler powered by pre-generated XML dictionaries.

Additional prototypes will land here over time as they are dusted off or built.
